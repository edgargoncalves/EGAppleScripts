# EGAppleScripts

These can be used to move the active window around the screen. It detects dock position and size (and whether it's hidden), and depending on the direction you choose, it'll swap between maximized, halved snapped to a screen edge or 1/3 of the usable screen size on either edge or middle of the screen.

A few notes:
- I use Quicksilver's keyboard triggered actions, one per each of the ResizeMoveWindow*.scpt compiled scripts.
- .applescript files are the text version of the scripts.
  - you can use osacompile to produce the scpt in an automated fashion - or just open them with ScriptEditor and save/Export them as scripts.
